[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xh645h4skw32pu6j?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Maxwe11/nmodbus4)

NModbus is a C# implementation of the Modbus protocol.
Provides connectivity to Modbus slave compatible devices and applications.
Supports serial ASCII, serial RTU, TCP, and UDP protocols.
NModbus4 it's a fork of NModbus(https://code.google.com/p/nmodbus).
NModbus4 differs from original NModbus in following:

1. removed USB support(FtdAdapter.dll)
2. removed log4net dependency
3. removed Unme.Common.dll dependency
4. assembly renamed to NModbus4.dll
5. target framework changed to .NET 4

Install
=======

To install NModbus4, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

    PM> Install-Package NModbus4

Change log
=======

Version **2.0** of **NModbus4** introduces some breaking changes.
## NModbus4 2.0.5516.31020 ##
In case of slave receives request with invalid function exception response would be returned to master instead of throwing ArgumentException (issue [#2](/../../issues/2)). 

Also introduced new exception type `InvalidModbusRequestException`. You can subscribe on slave's event `ModbusSlaveRequestReceived` and throw this exception. Thus you can filter incoming requests ([#6](/../../issues/6)).

Another breaking change related with ReadWriteMultiple function (0x17). Now it works in accordance with the Modbus spec -- performs write operation before read(fixes [#6](/../../issues/6)).

**API edition**

1. `IModbusMaster` and its implementations now have Async versions of its methods which return `Task`:

        Task<bool[]> ReadCoilsAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startAddress, ushort numberOfPoints);
        Task<bool[]> ReadInputsAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startAddress, ushort numberOfPoints);
        Task<ushort[]> ReadHoldingRegistersAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startAddress, ushort numberOfPoints);
        Task<ushort[]> ReadInputRegistersAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startAddress, ushort numberOfPoints);
        Task WriteSingleCoilAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort coilAddress, bool value);
        Task WriteSingleRegisterAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort registerAddress, ushort value);
        Task WriteMultipleRegistersAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startAddress, ushort[] data);
        Task WriteMultipleCoilsAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startAddress, bool[] data);
        Task<ushort[]> ReadWriteMultipleRegistersAsync(byte slaveAddress, ushort startReadAddress, ushort numberOfPointsToRead, ushort startWriteAddress, ushort[] writeData);

2. Opposite to event `ModbusSlaveRequestReceived` added event `WriteComplete` which fired by slave after write operation completed.

## NModbus4 2.0.5522.34406 ##
 - fixes issue [#7](/../../issues/7)
 - fixes issue [#8](/../../issues/8)
